### Emoji-Retrieval
A simple JavaScript application that would allow you to get the .png files or even .gif files of any emote that you desire!
Just enter in "<:emotename:emoteid>" and press run.
Pure Magic!

There are already emotes programmed in, as a starter.
### I attached this to the Kaylee Bot code because this would be pretty useful to have if you like to fetch emotes.
